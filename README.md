# language-ideologies

This repository includes the code for the paper:

> Watson, J., Lee, S., Barend, B., & Stevenson, S. (2025) Do language models practice what they preach? Examining language ideologies about gendered language reform encoded in LLMs. In Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics.

Note that running the sigular pronouns experiments requires data from Camilliere et al. (2021), which is not included in this repository. We requested the data from the authors directly.

Note that "experiment1" and "experiment2" are swapped compared to how they are labeled in the paper.
